                Effective software teams are essential for any organization to deliver value
                continuously and sustainably. But how do you build the best team organization for
                your specific goals, culture, and needs?
              </p>
              <p>
                Team Topologies is a practical, step-by-step, adaptive model for organizational
                design and team interaction based on four fundamental team types and three team
                interaction patterns. It is a model that treats teams as the fundamental means of
                delivery, where team structures and communication pathways are able to evolve with
                technological and organizational maturity.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Team Topologies, IT consultants Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais share secrets of
                successful team patterns and interactions to help readers choose and evolve the
                right team patterns for their organization, making sure to keep the software healthy
                and optimize value streams.
              </p>
              <p>
                Team Topologies is a major step forward in organizational design for software,
                presenting a well-defined way for teams to interact and interrelate that helps make
                the resulting software architecture clearer and more sustainable, turning inter-team
                problems into valuable signals for the self-steering organization.

                From the New York Times bestselling author of My Share of the Task and Leaders, a
                manual for leaders looking to make their teams more adaptable, agile, and unified in
                the midst of change.
              </p>
              <p>
                When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task
                Force in 2004, he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing.
                Al Qaeda in Iraq was a decentralized network that could move quickly, strike
                ruthlessly, then seemingly vanish into the local population. The allied forces had a
                huge advantage in numbers, equipment, and training—but none of that seemed to
                matter. To defeat Al Qaeda, they would have to combine the power of the world’s
                mightiest military with the agility of the world’s most fearsome terrorist network.
                They would have to become a "team of teams"—faster, flatter, and more flexible than
                ever.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Team of Teams, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced
                in Iraq can be relevant to countless businesses, nonprofits, and organizations
                today. In periods of unprecedented crisis, leaders need practical management
                practices that can scale to thousands of people—and fast. By giving small groups the
                freedom to experiment and share what they learn across the entire organization,
                teams can respond more quickly, communicate more freely, and make better and faster
                decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Drawing on compelling examples—from NASA to hospital emergency rooms—Team of Teams
                makes the case for merging the power of a large corporation with the agility of a
                small team to transform any organization.
