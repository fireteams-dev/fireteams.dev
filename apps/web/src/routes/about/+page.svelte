  <h1>About</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>
    At fireteams.dev, we recognise the power of compact, highly collaborative agile teams, to
    delivery software faster and with higher quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are a team of software engineers, architects, and project managers, who have worked in the
    trenches of software development for decades. We have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. We
    have seen the power of teamwork, and we have seen the power of teamwork squandered. We have seen
    the power of agile, and we have seen the power of agile squandered. Join us on our journey to
    unleash the power of teamwork in software development.
  </p>
  <h2>Our Origin</h2>
  <p>
    For years we honed our craft, using lean software delivery techniques, working towards
    creating more efficient and higher performing teams. The teams were fast and we had removed
    much of the waste in our processes, but to take it to the next level, we recognised that we
    needed to remove the handovers that remained and take advantage of true collaboration and teamwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      In August 2019, in the relaxed coastal city of Newcastle, Australia, the first software delivery fireteam was born.
    </p>
  <h2>Fireteams - A Fresh Perspective</h2>
  <p>
    Our "fireteams" comprise 4-5 specialized members, working together to deliver software faster and with higher
    quality. Work is assigned to the team, not to individuals and work-in-progress is limited to one item at a time,
    forcing the team to work together. This ensures a seamless, collaborative, and efficient software development journey.
  </p>
  <h2>Squads - Scaling the Fireteam Approach</h2>
  <p>
    While the concept of "squads" isn't unique to us, at fireteams.dev, we've tailored squads as a
    mechanism to scale our fireteam approach. A squad encompasses multiple fireteams, fostering a
    larger collaborative network of 10-15 members. This architecture ensures that as projects grow
    in complexity, our ability to deliver remains uncompromised, and innovation stays at the
    forefront.
  </p>
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    At fireteams.dev, we're guided by a simple truth: "Effective is efficient." By reimagining
    software development team structures, we're crafting a future where collaboration is paramount,
    and breakthroughs are the norm. Embark on this transformative journey with us.
